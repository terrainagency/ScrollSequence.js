# ScrollSequence.js

Dependencies: GSAP, GSAP Scroll Trigger

Demo: https://terrainagency.com/ghost/objects/scrollsequence/demo

## Usage

ScrollSequence is a <1kb (minified) object that creates a pinned sequence of panels. Each panels contains a master timelines with a scrollTrigger instance. 

The goal of ScrollSequence is to create an efficient workflow for building scroll based pages by advocating for separation of concern through restricting content to HTML, and animation to javascript. 


```javascript
import {ScrollSequence} from './utils.js'
```

## 1: HTML Structure

```HTML
<!-- ScrollSequence container -->
<div data-sequence="genesis" class="relative w-screen min-h-screen">
    <div data-panels class="absolute w-screen h-screen">
        <section data-panel="myFirstPanel" data-height="2" class="">

            <!-- Content for myFirstPanel -->

        </section>
        <section data-panel="mySecondPanel" data-height="4" class="">
            <div data-state="myFirstState">

                <!-- Content for myFirstState of mySecondPanel -->

            </div>
            <div data-state="mySecondState">

                <!-- Content for mySecondState of mySecondPanel -->

            </div>
        </section>
    </div>

    <!-- Trigger Container -->
    <div data-triggers class="relative w-full"></div>
</div>
```

> The `data-name` attribute attached to panels and states must have a value in order for them to be referenced.

## 2: Create a new ScrollSequence

```javascript
const sequence = new ScrollSequence({
    container: "[data-sequence]",
    panelsContainer: "[data-panels]", 
    triggerContainer: "[data-triggers]",
    panels: "[data-panel]", 
    debug: true, // 
})
```

Key | Type | Default | Description
------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------
container | string | [data-sequence] | Selector for the sequence
panelsContainer | string | [data-panels] | Selector of sequence panels to pin
triggerContainer | string | [data-triggers] | Selector for triggers to be placed in
panels | string | [data-panel] | Selector for panels
debug | boolean or object {r,g,b} | false | Turns debug mode off/on

The debug color settings can be overwritten by setting debug to an object: 

```javascript
const sequence = new ScrollSequence({
    debug: {r: "144", g: "100", b: "35"}
})
```


## 3: Define animations for each panel

```javascript
sequence.panels.forEach(panel => {
    switch(panel.name) {

        case "myFirstName":

            (() => {

                // Do something

            })()

            break
    }
}
```

> PanelName must match the data-panel value in the sequence object.

## 4: Configure Animtions

Each panel contains a master timeline `panel.master` containing a scrollTrigger `panel.master.scrollTrigger` instance. 

```javascript
sequence.panels.forEach(panel => {
    switch(panel.name) {
        case "myFirstName":

            (() => {

                // Create a timeline
                let tl = gsap.timeline({paused: true})
                tl.to(el, {options})

                // Add timeline to the master
                panel.master.add(tl)

            })()

            break
    }
}
```

> NOTE: the above is only an example of how to work with ScrollSequence.js, it can always be configured to suit your needs.

## Advanced Example

```javascript
sequence.panels.forEach(panel => {
    switch(panel.name) {
        case "intro":

            (() => {
                
                function toChair() {
                    let tl = gsap.timeline({paused: true})
                    tl.to(el, {options})

                    return tl
                }
                
                // Add timeline to the master
                panel.master.add(toChar())

            })()

            break
    }
}
```

## Panels

Panels are the main building blocks of a sequence.

Option | Default
------------ | ------------
[data-name] | undefined
[data-height] | undefined

## States

States are child elements of a panel that contain a section of content

Option | Default
------------ | ------------
[data-name] | undefined
[data-height] | flex-auto

## Status

ScrollSequence.js is a part of Terrain's Ghost library, and is currently in development. Ghost is a library of foundational code blocks, designed for practical use on projects built with GSAP and Tailwind.

Ghost's code is non-obtrusive, and does not create any actions without your direction. It is designed to be as agnostic as possible, allowing it to function freely accross a large variety of applications.

- [x] Basic architecture 
- [x] Integrate base panel ScrollTriggers
- [ ] Add padding parameter to sequence object with a default
- [ ] Allow panels to snap to tl labels
- [ ] Switch all debug css to inline styles
- [ ] Update on browser resize
- [ ] Add support for media queries
- [ ] Allow users to set their own scrollTrigger defaults
- [ ] Allow users to set their own default color for debug
- [x] Set defaults for container and panel queries
 
# Known issues

* data-height may violate the separation of concerns as it pertains more to animation than the content itself. 
* trigger container may violate the separation of concerns as it is required for functionality.
